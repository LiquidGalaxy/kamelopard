= kamelopard: Ruby gem to simplify production of KML

This gem simplifies generating KML files, especially those used by Google
Earth. See http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/kmlreference.html for
information on KML. The KML reference will provide information on undocumented
attributes from these classes.

== Requirements

It's probably best to use a fairly non-prehistoric verion of Ruby, as that's
what's most frequently tested.

== Installation

Install via RubyGems:

  gem install kamelopard

From source:

  rake install
