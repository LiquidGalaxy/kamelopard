# kamelopard: Ruby gem to simplify production of KML

This gem simplifies generating KML files, especially those used by Google
Earth. See https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference for
information on KML. Some attributes in Kamelopard classes don't have Rubydoc
documentation; the KML reference will provide information on attributes for
most of those attributes.

## Requirements

It's probably best to use a fairly non-prehistoric verion of Ruby, as that's
what's most frequently tested.

## Installation

Install via RubyGems:

  gem install kamelopard

From source:

  rake install

## License and distribution

Kamelopard is distributed under the terms of the Ruby license, included in the
file "LICENSE". The Ruby license also allows distribution under the terms of
the GPL, included in the file "GPL".
