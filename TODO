IDEAS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

* Add better logging, so, for instance, if a weird movement occurs in my tour,
  I can turn on debug logging to see where the flyto is being created.

* I suspect speed can change drastically across a spline's control points.
  Prove or disprove this, and if necessary, fix the problem.

* Collecting a set of tours into one document is difficult. Make it easy to do,
  and to add an index to the whole thing

* Creating master and slave versions of KMZ files for a galaxy is lots of
  busywork. Kamelopard should do it automatically.

* Improve helper functions, their tests, and their documentation

* Add a function to get the current camera position, if possible

* Add something to encode common screenoverlay size, screenxy, and overlayxy
  options, so I don't have to keep looking up the right values for things like
  "Keep the aspect ratio"
