IDEAS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

* Collecting a set of tours into one document is difficult. Make it easy to do,
  and to add an index to the whole thing

* Creating master and slave versions of KMZ files for a galaxy is lots of
  busywork. Kamelopard should do it automatically.

* Create function so objects can generate their own <Change>, etc. elements
  for an AnimatedUpdate

* Improve helper functions, their tests, and their documentation

* Add functions to generate various shapes in one and possibly two dimensions,
  and other functions to accept those paths as arguments to create flythroughs.
  These paths could include regular lines, lines where the points expand or
  contract geometrically or exponentially, sine and cosine functions (for
  making circles), etc., and other functions could take these paths as
  arguments to describe latitude, longitude, altitude, duration, heading, tilt,
  etc. For instance, a sine path passed to the tilt parameter would rock back
  and forth. sine and cosine passed to lat and long respectivally would travel
  in a circle. Adding an exponentially increasing range path would make it a
  spiral.

* Add a function to get the current camera position, if possible

* Add something to encode common screenoverlay size, screenxy, and overlayxy
  options, so I don't have to keep looking up the right values for things like
  "Keep the aspect ratio"
